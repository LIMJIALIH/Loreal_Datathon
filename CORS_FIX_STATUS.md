# ⚠️ CORS Fix - Waiting for Deployment

## Current Status

✅ **CORS Configuration Updated** - Code has been pushed to GitHub
⏳ **Waiting for Render Deployment** - Render is automatically deploying (takes 5-10 minutes)

## What Was Changed

Updated `backend/api.py` to allow ALL origins for API endpoints:
```python
CORS(app, 
     resources={r"/api/*": {"origins": "*"}},
     allow_headers=["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
     methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
     supports_credentials=False)
```

This will fix the CORS error you're seeing from Vercel.

## Testing the Fix

### Option 1: Use the Test Page (Recommended)

1. Open `test-cors.html` in your browser
2. Click "Test All Endpoints"
3. If you see ✅ SUCCESS, CORS is working!
4. If you see ❌ ERROR, wait 5-10 more minutes for Render to deploy

### Option 2: Check Render Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Find your service: `loreal-datathon`
3. Check the "Events" tab
4. Look for "Deploy succeeded" message
5. Once deployed, test your Vercel app

### Option 3: Browser Console Test

Open browser console on your Vercel app and run:
```javascript
fetch('https://loreal-datathon.onrender.com/api/metrics')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('✅ CORS Working!', d))
  .catch(e => console.log('❌ Still waiting...', e))
```

## Timeline

- **Now**: Code pushed to GitHub ✅
- **+2 minutes**: Render detects changes and starts build
- **+5-8 minutes**: Build completes
- **+8-10 minutes**: New version deployed with CORS fix ✅
- **+10 minutes**: Your Vercel app should work!

## Manual Deploy (If Needed)

If Render doesn't auto-deploy after 15 minutes:

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Select your `loreal-datathon` service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait 5-8 minutes for deployment

## Verify Deployment

Once deployed, your Vercel app at https://loreal-datathon.vercel.app should work without CORS errors.

## What to Expect

**Before Deployment:**
```
❌ Access to fetch at 'https://loreal-datathon.onrender.com/api/category-breakdown' 
   from origin 'https://loreal-datathon.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**After Deployment:**
```
✅ Data loads successfully
✅ No CORS errors in console
✅ App works normally
```

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

2. **Check Network Tab**
   - Open DevTools → Network
   - Refresh page
   - Click on API request
   - Check "Response Headers" for `access-control-allow-origin: *`

3. **Verify Render Deployment**
   - Check Render dashboard for deployment status
   - Look for any build errors in logs

4. **Test Direct API**
   - Visit: https://loreal-datathon.onrender.com/api/metrics
   - Should return JSON data
   - Check response headers in Network tab

## Contact Support

If CORS still doesn't work after 20 minutes:
- Check Render logs for errors
- Verify environment variables are set
- Try manual deployment from Render dashboard
